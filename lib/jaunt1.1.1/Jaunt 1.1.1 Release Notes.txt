CHANGES FOR VERSION 1.1.1

- bugfix: out-of-memory exception (heapsize) could occur if browser visited unsupported content type where content was a large file.
- bugfix: adding custom content-handlers by specifying content-type would fail in some cases where content-type included extra fields.
- bugfix: urls retained unresolved dot segments in some cases (eg http://foo.com/a/./a/../c.htm)
- bugfix: specifying UserAgentSettings.autosaveAsXML was autosaving the document as HTML rather than XHTML.
- bugfix: calling Document.getSource() would return the source of the last JSON request rather than the most recent HTML/XML request in a rare edge case.
- new feature: Document contains a new flag to specify whether the document was truncated as a result of specifying the setting UserAgentSettings.maxBytes.
